    /// The POSIX `openlog` function accepts a pointer to a C string. Though POSIX
    /// does not specify the expected lifetime of the string, all known
    /// implementations either
    /// 
    /// 1. keep the pointer in a global variable, or
    /// 2. copy the string into an internal buffer, which is kept in a global
    ///    variable.
    /// 
    /// When running with an implementation in the second category, the string may
    /// be safely freed right away. When running with an implementation in the
    /// first category, however, the string must not be freed until either
    /// `closelog` is called or `openlog` is called with a *different, non-null*
    /// `ident`.
    /// 
    /// This mutex keeps track of which `ident` was most recently passed, making it
    /// possible to decide whether `closelog` needs to be called before a given
    /// `ident` string is dropped.
    /// 
    /// (Note: In the original 4.4BSD source code, the pointer is kept in a global
    /// variable, but `closelog` does *not* clear the pointer. In this case, it is
    /// only safe to free the string after `openlog` has been called with a
    /// different, non-null `ident`. Fortunately, all present-day implementations
    /// of `closelog` either clear the pointer or don't retain it at all.)
